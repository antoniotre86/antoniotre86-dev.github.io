_I love data and do stuff with it._

I'm a Data Scientist, educated in Stats and ML, working in the field since 2013. 

I have an undergraduate degree in Economics from Bocconi University in Milan, a graduate degree in Statistics from Universita' La Sapienza in Rome, and a MSc in Machine Learning and Computational Statistics from University College London. Learned to code on the job; mainly Python, R and Scala. 

I've worked on natural language processing and information extraction, recommender systems, web user behaviour modelling and personalisation for e-commerce, product analytics, forecasting, reporting, BOT and anomaly detection in web sessions, user representation and profiling. 

Things that I'm enthusiastic about include, in random order: 
- NLP
- Bandit algorithms
- Bayesian optimisation
- Gaussian processes
- Statistical Learning Theory
- Anomaly detection

When I'm not thinking about the things above, I am being a tourist somewhere, hiking, cycling in the summertime, playing the piano (those 2/3 pieces I still remember), reading mostly scifi, watching old films and baking.

I am from Italy, currently based in {{ site.author.location }}.
